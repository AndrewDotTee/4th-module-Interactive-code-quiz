# 4th-module-Interactive-code-quiz
This is the 4th module for an interactive coding quiz.

## Objectives
This weekâ€™s Challenge was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Result
A basic HTML layout was created for this homework with separate sections for the quiz questions, choices, timer, score, and game-over screen. The CSS is a basic and simple responsive layout. JavaScript handles the quiz questions with six questions in total which includes starting the quiz, loading the questions, checking answers, updating the timer, and ending the quiz. 

The end user can save their score by entering their initials in the text box, which triggers the save function. The actual score saving process has not been coded yet and is javascript sided.
